This is a Spotify UI clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes basic music player functionality such as play/pause, next/previous track, progress bar, and playlist support.
I built this project to strengthen my frontend fundamentals while improving my understanding of the JavaScript Audio API, DOM manipulation, and UI layout.
